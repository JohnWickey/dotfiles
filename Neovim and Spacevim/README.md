# Neovim/Spacevim dotfiles
Neovim is Vim but better.  
Spacevim is like an auto-config for Vim that you can edit easily. I use it because it allows me to easily edit my config in Windows, and also because it integrates Vim with Windows with more ease.
  
The `.nvimrc` is located at `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\Appdata\Local\nvim` as `init.vim`. This folder is generated by Spacevim.  
The `.spacevimrc` is located at `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\.Spacevim.d` as `init.toml`.  
That file is also in this folder.
